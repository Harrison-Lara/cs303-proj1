## CS303-proj1 --> Infix Parser --> Data Structures

• Using stacks, write an infix expression parser.

• Your parser should parse an infix expression that supports
arithmetic and logical operators with specified precedencies.

• Parse an expression given in a string format. Your program should be flexible with
the given expressions. For instance, 1+2 is the same as 1 + 2. The user should not worry about
writing the spaces between operands and operators.

• Your program should check for invalid expressions, and produce meaningful error
messages when necessary. Further, the error message should indicate whether the error
happened (Only report the first error the program encounters and exits the program).
